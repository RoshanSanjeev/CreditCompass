On March 8th 2025, I participated in my first-ever hackathon, HackMercedX, and I’m proud to share that out of 120 participants,
my team and I won the Alumni Prize for our project, CreditCompass! 🏆

From sunup to sundown, we worked tirelessly to develop a smarter way to navigate credit card decisions. Our project helps adults not only 
choose the best credit cards for their current needs but also plan their long-term credit strategy—something that no other platform offers today.
